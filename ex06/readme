# C++, switch

## Overview
This exercise demonstrates the use of the `switch` statement in C++.

## Key Concepts
- **Switch Statement**: The `switch` statement is used to handle multiple conditions more efficiently than a series of `if-else if` statements. It improves readability and can make the code more concise.
- **Function Pointers**: The `Karen` class uses an array of function pointers to call the appropriate complaint method based on the input level.
- **Error Handling**: The `complain` method handles invalid input by printing an error message and simulating a wait before printing a follow-up message.

## Problems and Constraints
This use for a switch statement is not elegant at all, but other constraints in this exercise lead to this version. The `switch` in general is a good way to shorten if-else if situations and make the code more readable. I would have preferred to combine it with dynamic for loops here but bringing both together was astonishingly hard here. Partly also due to my added function overloading.
