# C++, References vs Pointers

## When to Use References
Use references when you know that the object being referred to will always exist and will not change. References are appropriate when the object is guaranteed to be valid for the lifetime of the reference.

## When to Use Pointers
Use pointers when you need to manage the lifetime of the object dynamically. Pointers are appropriate when the object may not always exist (i.e., it can be null) or when you need to reassign the pointer to point to different objects.

## Applying to HumanA and HumanB
- **HumanA**: Since HumanA will always be armed, it makes sense to use a reference for the Weapon. This ensures that the Weapon is always valid and cannot be null.
- **HumanB**: Since HumanB may not always have a Weapon, it makes sense to use a pointer for the Weapon. This allows the Weapon to be null and can be reassigned as needed.

Had to adapt the Weapon class to allow for a Weapon to be null.
